# The Locked Computer - Ella's New IT Adventure

It was a gray Tuesday morning, and Ella was on her way to the school's computer lab with her classmates. Since last week's incident with the flashing window, she had felt like a little IT security hero. She had even made a small hero cape at home from an old sheet that she had decorated with the text "INTERNET DETECTIVE" using glitter pens.

When the children entered the computer lab, they immediately noticed that something was wrong. Teacher Lisa was standing in front of the big screen with a furrowed brow and looking concerned.

"What is it, Teacher?" asked Johan, pointing to the screen where a strange message appeared with large red letters. Under the text, a clock was counting down.

"It seems that our school computer has been affected by something called ransomware," sighed Teacher Lisa. "And I was just about to show you the pictures from our field trip to the zoo."

"Ransom-what?" asked Ella, taking a few steps closer to the screen.

Teacher Lisa gathered the children in a semicircle in front of her. "Ransomware is like a locked treasure chest. Someone has locked up all our files and pictures in such a chest and wants money to give us the key."

"But that's theft!" exclaimed Ella indignantly.

"That's right," nodded Teacher Lisa. "That's exactly what it is. And that's why IT security is so important."

"But how did the thief get into the computer?" wondered Li with wide eyes.

Teacher Lisa sat on a chair so she was at eye level with the children. "Do you remember what we talked about last week? About being careful with what you click on?"

The children nodded eagerly.

"Someone in the school probably clicked on a link or opened a file that looked completely normal, but actually contained a program that locked our files," explained Teacher Lisa. "It's a bit like if someone gave you a present that looks nice, but when you open it, something scary jumps out and locks your room."

"Can't we just pay the money and get the pictures back?" asked Sofia.

Teacher Lisa shook her head. "That's never a good idea. First of all, we don't know if the person who locked our files will really give us the key if we pay. Secondly, it encourages them to continue doing this to others."

Ella scratched her head thoughtfully. "But how do you protect yourself against these treasure-lockers?"

"Great question! Ransomware protection involves several things," said Teacher Lisa and took out a large piece of paper where she began to draw. "First of all, just as we talked about last week, you should be careful about what you click on and open."

Teacher Lisa drew a computer with a shield in front of it.

"Secondly, it's important to make backups. That means saving your important files in multiple places." She drew several small clouds next to the computer. "Fortunately, we have all our important files and pictures saved on the school's secure server, so we haven't lost anything forever."

"So we can get the pictures from the zoo back?" asked Johan with relief.

"Absolutely! IT manager Stefan will help us clean the computer and restore all files from our backup later today."

Ella raised her hand. "But what do we do if someone does accidentally click on something bad?"

"Then it's important to tell an adult immediately," answered Teacher Lisa. "The sooner you discover the problem, the easier it is to solve it. And you should never be ashamed for making a mistake – the important thing is that you learn from it."

Suddenly Ella clapped her hands. "I have an idea! Can we do a play about ransomware for the other classes? So that all children learn how to protect themselves?"

Teacher Lisa smiled broadly. "That's a fantastic idea, Ella! We can make a small play where you show how ransomware works and how to protect yourself."

"I can be the treasure-locker!" shouted Johan eagerly.

"And I can be the backup that saves the day!" suggested Li.

During the following days, the class worked hard on their ransomware play. Ella, now in her homemade IT hero cape, played the lead role as the vigilant internet detective who taught everyone how to protect their digital treasures.

When they performed for the school's other classes, they ended with a song they had written themselves:

*"Never click, never open  
Anything strange, anything new  
Always ask an adult first  
And save everything in an extra new place!  
We are the friends of IT security  
We protect our files every day  
So that no treasure-lockers  
Can take our pictures, no, no, no!"*

After the performance, the school principal came to Teacher Lisa with tears in her eyes.

"This is the best thing I've seen! Even I understand now what ransomware is. Maybe we should do a performance for the parent meeting next month too?"

And so it was. Ella's class became the school's IT security ambassadors, and Ella herself felt that she had found her superpower – making difficult IT security questions easy to understand, even for adults.

When Ella told her mother about the day later that evening, she said proudly: "Mom, do you know what? Protecting yourself against ransomware is actually quite simple. You just need to be careful about what you click on, make backups, and know who to ask for help when something goes wrong."

Her mother smiled and said: "You know, I think I should learn more about this myself. Maybe you can teach me?"

And Ella certainly could.
