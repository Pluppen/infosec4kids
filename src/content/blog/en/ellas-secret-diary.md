# Ella's Secret Diary - About the Right to Privacy

A month had passed since Ella's class had become the school's IT security heroes. Their theater performance about ransomware had become so popular that even parents had asked if it could be shown at the next parent meeting. Ella still proudly wore her homemade "INTERNET DETECTIVE" cape sometimes, especially on computer days.

On a sunny Wednesday, the class was sitting in a circle on the large rug in the classroom. Teacher Lisa was holding something that looked like a beautifully decorated little book with a small lock on it.

"What is that, Teacher?" asked Sofia curiously.

"This," said Teacher Lisa, holding up the book, "is a diary. My big sister gave it to me when I was your age."

"What did you write in it?" asked Johan.

Teacher Lisa smiled mysteriously. "I'm actually not going to tell you that."

The children looked surprised. Teacher Lisa usually always answered their questions.

"But why not?" wondered Li.

"Because what's in my diary is private. It's my own thoughts and feelings that I didn't want to share with others at that time. And that leads us to today's topic – privacy and the right to personal space."

Ella wrinkled her nose. "Privacy? Like when you're alone in the bathroom?"

Some children giggled, but Teacher Lisa nodded seriously. "Yes, that's actually a good example. Can anyone say why we close the door when we go to the bathroom?"

"Because it's embarrassing if someone sees!" shouted Johan.

"Because it's private," said Li quietly.

"Exactly," said Teacher Lisa. "There are things we do and think that we don't want everyone else to see or know about. That doesn't mean we're doing anything wrong or that we have something to hide. It's about respect for ourselves and our privacy."

Ella thought about her own diary at home, the one with pink covers and a small heart-shaped lock. She had written about how she felt about Simon in the parallel class and how sad she had been when her hamster Piff died last year. It would be terrible if someone read that without permission!

"But what about on the internet?" asked Ella. "Do you have privacy there too?"

"What a great question, Ella!" said Teacher Lisa. "On the internet, privacy is something we need to think about even more. Every time we use apps, play games online, or visit websites, we leave traces behind – a bit like footprints in the snow."

"What kind of traces?" asked Johan.

"For example, information about what we like, where we are, who our friends are, and which websites we visit. Many companies collect this information to get to know us better."

"But isn't it good if companies know us? Then we get things we like," said Sofia.

"It might seem so," nodded Teacher Lisa. "But imagine if someone followed you all day, writing down everything you do, who you talk to, what you eat, which books you read... How would that feel?"

The children looked uncomfortable at the thought.

"Strange," said Li. "And a bit scary."

"Exactly. Even if we're not doing anything 'secret' or 'wrong', we sometimes just want to be left alone. It's part of being human – to have certain thoughts and actions to yourself."

Ella raised her hand. "But my mom always says that if you haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about."

Teacher Lisa smiled. "That's a common thought. But think of it this way – have you ever wanted to try a new hairstyle or dance style but were afraid someone would laugh? Or maybe written a poem that you didn't want to show to anyone yet?"

Ella nodded.

"Being able to experiment, grow, and develop at your own pace, without always being monitored, is also a part of privacy. It's not about 'having something to hide' but about having a space where you can be completely yourself."

Teacher Lisa took out a large piece of paper and began to draw.

"Imagine that privacy is like a house with many rooms. Some rooms we gladly show to everyone – like the living room. Other rooms, like the bedroom, we might only show to our closest friends. And the diary, we might keep entirely to ourselves."

"How do you protect your privacy on the internet?" asked Ella.

"There are several ways," said Teacher Lisa. "First, you can be careful about what information you share. Does the game really need to know where you live? Second, you can use strong passwords so that not just anyone can access your accounts. And third, you can talk to an adult before downloading new apps or registering on new sites."

Ella thought for a moment. "But if everyone always monitors each other, wouldn't we always just do things that others like? Never try new things or say what we really think?"

Teacher Lisa smiled broadly. "Exactly, Ella! That's why privacy is so important for democracy and freedom. If we always feel monitored, we become afraid to be different or think differently. Then inventors might not dare to invent new things, artists might not create art that challenges, or ordinary people might not say what they think about injustices."

Suddenly Ella had an idea. She whispered something to Li beside her, who giggled and nodded.

"Teacher Lisa," said Ella, "I think I know how we can show what privacy means to the other classes!"

During the following days, the class worked on their new project. They built a large "privacy house" out of cardboard boxes, with different rooms representing different levels of privacy. In the living room, they hung pictures of things that were okay to share with everyone – like favorite colors and pets. In the bedroom were things that you only shared with close friends, like dreams and secrets. And in the secret room was a locked diary and notes with the children's innermost thoughts, which no one was allowed to see.

They also showed how companies and apps collect information by having some students play "computer spies" who followed other children around with notepads and wrote down everything they did.

After the performance, the school principal came up to Teacher Lisa again.

"This was even better than the previous performance! I think I actually need to think more about my own digital privacy."

On the way home from school that day, Ella eagerly told her mother about their project.

"Mom, do you know what? Even if you haven't done anything wrong, privacy is important. It's about being able to be yourself sometimes, without always caring what others think."

Her mother looked thoughtful. "You know, I've never actually thought about it like that. I've always said that I have nothing to hide, but I actually wouldn't want everyone to be able to see everything I do on the internet."

"No, exactly!" said Ella. "And do you know what Teacher Lisa said? She said that privacy isn't about hiding something bad, but about protecting something valuable – like yourself and your thoughts."

That evening, Ella sat down and wrote in her diary, now with a new understanding of why the little key to the lock was so important. It wasn't about her having secrets that were "bad," but about her thoughts and feelings having value in themselves. And the right to decide who got to partake in them – that right was worth protecting.

On the last page, she drew a large house with many rooms and wrote in her finest handwriting: "Privacy – not because I have something to hide, but because I have something valuable to protect."
